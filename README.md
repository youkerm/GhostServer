# Ghost Server

A Web Socket Server written in NodeJS utilizing my other project GeoBuddy. This server works connects users from different geolocations (From GeoBuddy) and allows users to communicate with one another on an open bulletin. The project was to mimick Yik Yak, but utilizie a Web Socket Server for less overhead.
